## üì¶ Project Installation

To deploy and test this application locally:

### 1. Clone the repository
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/Sameh09/SeoEra_Test.git
cd SeoEra_Test
</pre>
### 2. Install Dependencies
<pre>
composer install
</pre>
### 3. Install the Project Automatically
<pre>
php artisan install:project
</pre>
‚ö†Ô∏è During the development process, I executed the migrate:fresh command as part of the php artisan install:project setup automation. Unfortunately, this action reset the database and resulted in the removal of previously logged data, including entries recorded by Laravel Telescope.

I sincerely apologize for this oversight, as it may have affected the completeness of historical logs and database data intended for review.
